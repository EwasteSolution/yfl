ok yad for lua im pretty sure this one is gonna stick yad is the more advanved and complete branch of zenity this is a lua wrapper 
there should be no dependencys besides lua and yad.It is a work in progress so any help is wellcome for 1 and also it may be a bit buggy I apologize.
This work is under the GNU v3.0 lua uses MIT but yad uses the GNU so I went whith that as long as yad is in your PATH and this modual is in LUAPATH it 
should work just fine.
